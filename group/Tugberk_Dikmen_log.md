On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. 
This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ until 02.05.2020 ~
Until this week I work on main screen and menu driver object. While doing those I learned how to 
design user interface, how android studio works and adding zoom properties to image on android studio. 
While compleating those steps we brainstormed about the erros that we had. When this week is over we had fully working menu and main screen. 
### ~ 02.05.2020 - 10.05.2020 ~
In this week I worked on how to add and implement markers and buttons to the zoomable image view on android studio.
In addition, I sperated the map view into three part in order to make it more easy for users. Last, we worked on combining all the the part of the project ass a group.
