On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ until 02.05.2020 ~

This week I learned sending variables from activity to activity in Android Studio. Also I learden to open new activity when I click a button. This week me and Faruk made a brainstorm about Settings page. We helped each other because his page and my page have connection. We made profile page.

### ~ from 02.05.2020 until 11.05.2020 ~

We combined our parts with Faruk. Thus, interface of the profile page has been completed. We will try to find out how to include Firebase in the project. Also ,as a group, we tried to combine all parts. However we encountered with some errors. We are still working to combine all parts.
