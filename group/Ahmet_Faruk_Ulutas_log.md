On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ until 02.05.2020 ~
So far I have made the interface of the user profile page and tried to fix the errors that other group members received. In doing so, I learned how to use Android Studio, how to use layouts and how to use various attributes; how to design the user page, add textField etc., how to make the places of the fields.
