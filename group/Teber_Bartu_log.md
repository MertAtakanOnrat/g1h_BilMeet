On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### Until 02.05.2020
I learn basic tools and use of Android Studio by reading and watching tutorials. After determining the project details by discussing them together, I started working on my own part, the design of login and register page.  After determining the design of the login and register page, I started working on the code. I brainstormed with the group members on the errors I encountered. After consulting the TA on the last remaining error, I completed the login and register page design.
