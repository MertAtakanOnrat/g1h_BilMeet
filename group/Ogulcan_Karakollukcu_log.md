On This page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

So far, I have made the event list page of our application.I learned how android studio works. While doing this page, I learned to make the components visible and invisible and to adjust the position of the panels aesthetically.
I had some difficulties in coding the actions that should be done when we click on the buttons, but I got over it.Apart from these, I tried to help my group friends as much as I could.
