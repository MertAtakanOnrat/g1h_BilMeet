On This page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

So far, I have made the event list page of our application.I learned how android studio works. While doing this page, I learned to make the components visible and invisible and to adjust the position of the panels aesthetically.
I had some difficulties in coding the actions that should be done when we click on the buttons, but I got over it.Apart from these, I tried to help my group friends as much as I could.

### ~ from 02.05.2020 until 11.05.2020 ~
We tried to combine the parts we made under one project. We got various errors (null reference, null pointers, package errors ...). We corrected most of the errors and combined some parts. I also create the 'Create an Event' page that allows user to create an even with specific name and type.

This week we first worked on adding a location cursor on the map. Tuğberk and i figured out how to integrate library that Tuğberk found about this situation into our own code and add it to our code. We fixed some errors in the code. Then, when I clicked the cursors on the map, I tried to get the activities of that region to come.
